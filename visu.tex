\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Voting rules are prominent objects used in social choice theory to aggregate preference information and obtain a societal choice.

Various rules treat the profile, the information given as input, differently, according to the transformations considered to not change the information \citep{sen_social_1986, sen_informational_1974, sen_weights_1977, blackorby_social_1984}.

In this article we define and categorize different visualizations using a systematic approach and investigate a principled way of choosing a visualization according to the information of interest in the profile. Although this principle does not fully automate the choice of the visualization -- because some aspects of choosing a right visualization are subjective or depend on the task in ways that we do not take into account -- the principle we propose permits to narrow down the possibilities, to partly justify the choice and to avoid mistakes, in a spirit similar to that which guides axiomatic analysis of voting rules. Our contribution might also be useful to those who wish to categorize visualizations for other purposes, as we propose a language that describes these visualizations and that permits to analyze them.

We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with two tasks involving visualization.

\section{Main concepts and notations}
We consider defined a set of alternatives $\allalts$ and a set of voters $\allvoters$. The preference of a voter $i \in \allvoters$ is represented by a linear order $\pref_i \subseteq \allalts × \allalts$ (a transitive, connected and antisymmetric binary relation) over the alternatives. The set of all linear orders is denoted by $\linors$, thus $\pref_i \in \linors$. A profile $\prof: \allvoters → \linors$ associates each voter to her preference. The set of all profiles is $\allprofs = \linors^\allvoters$. A voting rule $f: \allprofs → \powersetz{\allalts}$, where $\powersetz{S}$ denotes the set of all non empty subsets of $S$, associates to each profile a set of winners, a non-empty subset of the alternatives. Sets are used to tolerate ties.

	\label{fig:rankprofile}
\end{figure}

The information contained in a profile can be viewed in various ways. For example, instead of displaying the linear orders below each voters, as is most classical, the profile may be viewed as a matrix which indicates, for each alternative and voter, the rank of the alternative in the ranking of the voter \citep{cailloux_eliciting_2014}. See \cref{fig:rankprofile}.
More generally, we view a profile as a \emph{scoring profile}, an association of numbers to voters and alternatives: each voter is associated to a utility function $u_i: \allalts → \R$, which describes the “score” this voter gives to each alternative. Thus, we denote a scoring profile by $\prof = \profdet$. (Abusing notation, we reuse the same letter $\prof$ to denote a scoring profile under this more general conception and reuse the letter $\allprofs$ to denote the set of all scoring profiles.)

In the following, we will also consider the (weighted) majority graph of a profile. The \emph{majority margin} $m$ is the function that maps each pair of candidates $(x, y) \in \allalts^2$ to the difference between the number of voters that prefer $x$ to $y$ and the number of voters that prefer $y$ to $x$, namely: $m(x, y) = |\{i\in N:\ x \pref_i y\}| - |\{i\in N:\ y \pref_i x\}|$.  The \emph{majority relation} is the binary relation $\succeq_{\Maj}$ defined as the subset of elements $(x, y) \in N^2$ such that $m(x, y) \geq 0$. The binary relation $\pref_{\Maj}$ is the strict part of $\succeq_{\Maj}$; therefore if $x \pref_{\Maj} y$, we say that $x$ (strictly) beats $y$ in a pairwise election (or comparison). The \emph{weighted majority graph} $\mathcal{WG}$ is the weighted directed graph representing $\succeq_{\Maj}$, with $m(x,y)$ being the weight of arc $(x, y)$. The majority graph $\mathcal{G}$ is the unweighted version of the weighted majority graph. A \emph{Condorcet winner} is a candidate that strictly beats every other candidate in a pairwise election, that is, the only candidate (if any) that has no incoming edge in $\mathcal{G}$.

We denote by $\sim$ an equivalence relation on the set of profiles; an analysis of various such equivalence relation will be given below.

In this article, a visualization is a function $v: \allprofs → D$, where $D$ is the space of 2D-drawings. Thus, $v$ maps any scoring profile it is given to a static picture.

\section{Tasks and visualization}
To make our interest concrete, let us start by proposing two kinds of tasks that will illustrate the usefulness of this classification. 
Those tasks can be registered under the explainable-AI movement, which studies ways of letting users understand the result of procedures developped in artificial intelligence.

\subsection{Train to identify winners}
The first kind of task is: given a visualization $v$ and a voting rule $f$, train the user to compute the winners $f(\prof)$, given $v(\prof)$, for any profile $\prof \in \allprofs$. This is done in two phases. First, in the training phase, the user is shown a profile $\prof$, using $v(\prof)$ and other visualizations selected by the trainer $v_1(\prof)$, $v_2(\prof)$, …, and the winners $f(\prof)$. The trainer has selected beforehand supplementary visualizations $\set{v_i}$ with the hope to help the user understand how the winner is computed. Second, in the test phase, the user is shown only the profile using only the imposed visualization $v(\prof)$, and has to find the winner by himself. Such task could be used either to experimentally compare training procedures, actually, compare different sets of supplementary visualizations; or to get an experimental idea of the difficulty of understanding various voting rules.

For this kind of task, we expect it will be helpful to the user to see the profile with varying informational content (varying interpretations). For example, for computing the Condorcet winner, it might be helpful in the training phase to see the starting profile, the profile reduced to its majority graph information, and the resulting Condorcet winner. For computing the Borda winners, it might be helpful, starting from the profile considered as linear orders, to train the user by showing the profile enriched with the score information per voter, then go to the score per alternative view, and finally show the Borda winners.

In this article we suggest a default algorithm to help such a trainer select the intermediate visualizations $v_1, v_2, …$; and help define the task itself by providing a set of possible visualizations $V$ among which to pick $v$.

Broadly speaking, our default algorithm is that, given a voting rule $f$, we search for an interpretation $\sim$, as poor as possible, that conserves the information useful to $f$: such that $f(\prof) = f(\prof')$ if $\prof \sim \prof'$. (This information is generally known in the literature from axiomatic analysis, or obvious, for most well-known voting rules.) This is then used to find appropriate visualizations.

\subsection{Compare voting rules}
The second kind of task is a comparison task.  Here we wish to illustrate visually the difference of “reasoning” of two voting rules $f^1$ and $f^2$. Using a principle similar to the one described above, we would search for an interpretation $\sim^i$ corresponding to the poorest equivalence relation (among our set of proposals described below) that conserves the information useful to $f^i$, for $i \in \set{1, 2}$. Define $\sim^*$ the least upper bound of $\sim^1$ and $\sim^2$, thus, the poorest equivalence relation that is richer than both $\sim^1$ and $\sim^2$. Then we show, to illustrate $f^1$ and $f^2$ on $\prof$, the interpretation of $\prof$ using a visualization appropriate for $\sim^*$, then on opposite sides of the screen, a visualization appropriate for $\sim^i$ and the winners according to $f^i$, $i \in \set{1, 2}$. \commentOC{Should probably be moved where it can be understood.}

Or something like that.

\section{Information in a profile}
Here we indicate which information a profile contains.
We will relate this to visual variables in a later section.

Interestingly, depending on the purpose of the visualization, the informational content to be taken into account when considering a profile may change. In order to let the viewer focus on the relevant information, the informational content in the profile may be reduced. For example, if the focus is to explain the Condorcet property, it may be adequate to display only information necessary to deduce the majority graph. Or, when being interested in scoring rules, it may be desired to display only, for each alternative, the ranks it obtained, that is, a multi-set of ranks, neglecting the relation between the voters and the ranks. Conversely, in some cases, such as in the context of exemplifying a given voting rule, it may be desired to show more than the information contained in the profile. A prominent example is the one of scoring rules: when the scores to be used are known, what is to be aggregated may be viewed as the scores given by each voter to each alternative. In yet other cases, the information to be visualized is both poorer and richer (in different respects), as when showing, for each alternative, a multiset of scores with no individual link between the voters and the scores.

In this section we want to classify systematically visualization approaches depending on the informational content to be taken into account, in order to move towards being able to select an appropriate visualization in a principled way. Informational content can be characterized thanks to an equivalence relation on the set of scoring profiles $\allprofs$. 
\begin{description}
	\item[OM-NC] To start with, consider \emph{Ordinally Measurable, Noncomparable Utilities}: in this interpretation, two profiles are equivalent iff they describe the same orderings for each voter. Formally, a profile $\prof = \profdet[u_i]$ is considered equivalent to any profile $\prof' = \profdet[\phi_i(u_i)]$ where $\phi_i: \R^\allalts → \R^\allalts, i \in N$ are non-decreasing transformations of the utilities. When using this interpretation of the informational content of a profile, only the orderings represented by the utilities count. This is the classical input information considered for a voting rule, as described above.
	\item[CM-NC] One can also attribute more meaning to the numbers in the utility functions. In the \emph{Cardinally Measurable, Noncomparable Utilities} interpretation, the $\phi_i$ transformations must be of the form $\phi_i(u_i) = a_i + b_i u_i$ for some $a_i \in \R, b_i \in \R^{*+} = \R \cap (0, +\infty)$.
	\item[CM-FC] The \emph{Cardinally Measurable, Fully Comparable Utilities} interpretation mandates that the $\phi_i$ transformation be of the form $\phi_i(u_i) = a + b u_i$ for some $a \in \R, b \in \R^{*+}$, the same for all voters. In other words, it supplements the requirements of the previous interpretation by forcing equality of the transformations: $\phi_i = \phi_j \forall i, j \in \allvoters$.
	\item[PM-FC] The \emph{Proportionally Measurable, Fully Comparable Utilities} interpretation \commentOC{We should decide whether we like that name.} allows only transformations of the form $\phi_i(u_i) = b u_i$, $b \in \R^{*+}$.
	\item[WMG] In the \emph{Weighted Majority Graph} interpretation, two profiles are equivalent iff they have the same weighted majority graph.
	\item[MG] In the \emph{Majority Graph} interpretation, two profiles are equivalent iff they have the same majority graph.
	\item[RC] In the \emph{Rank Count} interpretation, two profiles are equivalent iff, for each alternative and rank, the number of times the alternative receives the rank (is positioned at that rank by some voter) is the same in both profiles.
	\item[SC] The \emph{Score Count} interpretation is similar to RC except the alternatives must receive each scores (not merely rank) the same number of times.
	\item[SS] For the \emph{Sum Scores} interpretation, the sum of the scores is what matters: two profiles are equivalent iff, for each alternative, the sum of the scores received in both profile match.
\end{description}
Other interpretations are defined by \citet{blackorby_social_1984}, from which we took some of these interpretations.

An equivalence relation $\sim$ on the set of scoring profiles is said to be finer than another equivalence relation $\sim'$ iff $\prof \sim \prof' ⇒ \prof \sim' \prof'$, thus, iff $\sim \subseteq \sim'$, or still equivalently, iff $\sim$ defines smaller equivalence classes than $\sim'$. In that case, the interpretation associated to $\sim$ is said to be richer than the interpretation associated to $\sim'$, and conversely, the latter interpretation is said to be poorer. Equivalently, an interpretation is richer than another one iff any profile transformation $\phi$ that does not cross the boundary of an equivalence class in the richer interpretation also does not cross equivalence classes in the poorer interpretation. Finally, it is still equivalent to say that an interpretation is richer than another one iff, given any equivalence class of the richer interpration, there is exactly one equivalence class of the poorer interpretation that contains all the given equivalence class.

\Cref{fig:poorer} shows the relation between some of the just defined interpretations.

\section{Visualizations}
\subsection{Graphic variables}
Giving a (possibly interactive) graphical representation to a data set is a way to make the information it contains more graspable to laymen, provided the representation is sound.
The design of such representations is studied by the Information Visualisation community.
A key step of the \emph{InfoVis Pipeline}~\citep{Chi-Riedl-1998} which transforms data into visualisations is the \emph{visual mapping}, i.e.\ the step that encodes \emph{data attributes} with \emph{graphic variables}.
For example, if each item of a data set is a person characterized by some attributes (age, genre, size, weight, etc.), we can encode a particular item with a graphic mark, and we may choose to represent the genre by its shape (e.g.\ square for men, circle for women), the weight by the abscissa, and the size by the ordinate.
The set of graphic variables that can be used without too much interference is rather small: \citet[][chap.~II.c]{bertin-graphique} gave one of the first practical list that includes 8 variables.
This list remains relevant today, even if it has been enriched latter to account for computer screens and animations~\citep[e.g.][chap.~5]{munzner}.

A key observation made by Bertin is that all graphic variables are not equal in term of expressiveness.
Some allow to judge wether two items are identical or not (e.g.\ they share the same shape), but others allow to tell wether one is bigger than the other, and even to quantify how much bigger it is (e.g.\ the abscissa of one mark is twice the abscissa of another one).
A variable is \emph{associative} ($\equiv$) if it allows to represent different levels without inducing a visual hierarchy between those levels.
A variable is \emph{selective} ($\neq$) if all items sharing a level (e.g.\ same color) can be perceived as a group and considered for inspection without the items of other levels interfering.
A variable is \emph{ordered} ($O$) if we can order two items according to this variable, without relying on a lookup to a legend.
Finally, a variable is \emph{quantitative} ($Q$) if we can quantify the difference between two items.

The two cartesian dimensions (when working in the plane) of the \emph{position} are two variables that are the most expressive: they support $\equiv$, $\neq$, $O$ and $Q$.
The \emph{size} of the mark is also very expressive: it supports $\neq$, $O$ and $Q$ but not $\equiv$ (large marks will pop up).
The \emph{value}, i.e.\ the grey level independently of the hue, is also $\neq$ and $O$ but not $\equiv$ and not $Q$ (darker grey will pop up on a white background and we can not quantify how much darker or lighter is a grey from another grey).
The \emph{texture} (the scale of a given pattern used to fill a mark) is $\equiv$, $\neq$ and $O$, but not $Q$.
The \emph{color}, i.e.\ the hue independently of the grey level, is both $\equiv$ and $\neq$, but can not be used for $O$ and $Q$.
The \emph{orientation} can be used for $\equiv$ and, to a certain extend, for $\neq$, provided the shape of the mark does not present too much symmetries.
Finally, the \emph{shape} of the mark can be used only for $\equiv$ if the various shapes are carefully chosen.

\subsection{Categorization of visualizations}
Here we describe a synthetic language that describes visualizations. The descriptions should: permit to evaluate for which interpretation a visualization is or is not appropriate; permit to identify all important aspects of a visualization, in particular, allow to indicate which information in a profile is displayed, where, and how; and permit to combine multiple visualizations in order to build a single image displaying multiple interpretations of a given profile. (TODO: get inspiration from \cref{sec:grib}.)

We consider the input of a visualization to be always a scoring profile. Variables $\var{a}, \var{v}$ can be used in the description, referring to alternatives and voters. These are supplemented by dynamic variables, which refer to information that can be deduced from a profile. Dynamic variables are considered part of the definition of a visualization and not part of our description language, so that variables can be added without changing the language. Below, the dynamic variable $\var{r}$ refers to $\intvl{1, m}$, the possible ranking positions; and $\var{r}(\var{a}, \var{v})$ refers to the function which gives the position of $a$ according to $v$, thus a number in $\intvl{1, m}$. Abusing notation slightly, we consider $\var{v}$ as a set when it is used alone, and as a function when it is used with parenthesis or when specified explicity. We use similarly $\var{s}$ and $\var{s}(\var{a}, \var{v})$ to refer to the scores and the scoring function. Also, strict orderings are defined for each variable: $<_\var{a}$ on $\allalts$, $<_\var{v}$ on $\allvoters$, and orderings for the dynamic variables. In our examples, $<_\var{r}$ represents the classical ordering on the positive integers and $<_\var{s}$ the one on the reals.

A visualization is described using a set of description parts. A part is a left hand side, an arrow, and a right hand side. The following parts are legal.
\begin{description}
	\item[$\var{w}→X$] partitions $X$ into equal-sized intervals and assigns those intervals to the values of $\var{w}$, from left to right, in the order given by $>_\var{w}$. A similar definition holds for $Y$, from top to bottom.
	\item[$(\var{w}, \textnormal{prop})/\var{y}→X$] (where $y$ is assigned to intervals of $Y$ and where $\var{w}$ is a function of $\var{y}$ and possibly other parameters) iterates on the values of $\var{y}$. For each $y \in \var{y}$ and each $w \in \var{w}$, it counts the proportion of inputs to the function $\var{w}$ with value $y$ that give value $w$. For each $y$, it cuts $X$ into intervals whose sizes follow those proportions, ordered according to $<_\var{w}$. This defines, for each $y$ and $w$, a 2D area composed of the interval of $X$ just described and the interval of $Y$ associated to $y$. It assigns those areas to the corresponding pairs $(w, y)$. Now the pair $(w, y)$ is considered assigned to both an interval of $X$ and an interval of $Y$. A similar definition holds where $X$ is replaced by $Y$ everywhere, and conversely $Y$ by $X$.
	\item[$\var{w}/\var{x}→SX$] (where $x$ is associated to intervals of $X$) sub-divides every interval of $X$ (corresponding to some $x$) into equals sub-intervals, one for each $w$, and associates to each $(x, w)$ the corresponding sub-interval.
	\item[$\var{w}/\var{x}, \var{y}→SX$] (where $\var{x}, \var{y}$ are associated to intervals of $X$ and $Y$ and $\var{w}$ is a function of $\var{x}$ and $\var{y}$) iterates over the pairs $(x, y)$. For each $(x, y)$, it uses $\var{w}(x, y) \in \R$ to compute a proportion of the interval of $X$ associated to $\var{x}$: if the value is zero, the empty interval is returned; if the value is $M$ (a value considered defined once and for all for the visualization using this description), the full interval is returned. This defines a 2D area, which gets associated to the triple $(w, x, y)$.
	\item[$\var{w}/\var{x}, \var{y}→X$] similar, where $\var{x}$ may not be associated to an interval of $X$ and instead of computing a proportion of that interval, a proportion of the whole $X$ size is determined.
	\item[$\var{w}/\var{x}, \var{y}→Z$] (where $Z$ is the treatment letter $C$, $T$ or $L$, where $\var{w}$ is a function of $\var{x}$ and $\var{y}$ and where the pairs $(x, y)$ must be assigned to intervals of both $X$ and $Y$) iterates on the values of $\var{w}$. For each $w \in \var{w}$, it considers the set of values of $\var{x}$ and $\var{y}$ that are associated to $w$. This defines a set of zones in the 2D space through the intervals associated to the pairs $(x, y)$. The treatment $Z$ is applied to those zones, depending on the value $w$. Letters $C$, $T$ and $L$ represent Color, Texture and Line. For example, in case $Z=C$, a color is chosen depending on $w$, and used to fill the corresponding zones. Note that a pair $(x, y)$ is considered assigned to intervals of both $X$ and $Y$ if the intervals have been assigned using different description entries, or if a 2D area has been assigned to the pair $(x, y)$. \commentOC{This definition is not entirely satisfactory as it’s not necessarily two variables that are associated to intervals, can be a pair or a triplet. We probably need to have a variable that represents the parameter of $\var{w}$ and a function that transforms this parameter into a set of variable values assigned together to a 2D area.}
\end{description}
The part of a description including the slash and what follows it can be omitted if this causes no ambiguity. Not all sets of parts are legal, as there are constraints on which bindings must be present for certain parts. If a description includes no treatment, then a “fill” treatment is considered implicit (\cref{it:vert,it:squares} for example).

\section{Relating informational content and visual variables}
Here we describe how we go (as automatically as possible) from the descriptions given so far to visualizations such as those illustrated in \cref{sec:grib}.

TODO we have two tasks. First, indicate that $\prof \sim \prof' \iff v(\prof) = v(\prof')$ is good (as described below); second, answer the question: does the drawing encourage “wrong” operations (such as comparing size of scores under an ordinal interpretation) or discourage permitted operation (as for example when differentiating ranks with color or not permitting easy comparison of the number of scores for a given alt). Note that selecting a color arbitrarily to associate it to a rank does not introduce comparison operations whereas selecting a line width does.

Depending on the task that the visualisation is used for, different kind and richness of information should be presented. For example, if the task is to find a Condorcet winner given a profile, it seems adequate to choose a visualisation which allows to clearly see the majority graph (an information somewhat poorer than the rank profile, in the sense that the information class is wider). If the task is to find the Borda winners given a profile, the visualisation could on the contrary enrich the rank profile by giving access to the scores, and it should do so by encouraging the user to perform quantitative comparisons (Q) rather than just permit ordinal comparisons as is adequate with ranks information or majority-graph information. \commentOC{To rephrase. This mixes up two things that should better be kept separate. The equivalence classes on a profile (interpretation) should not change, we can simply adopt a richer visualization (paying the price by having a visualization that may encourage irrelevant operations).}

Given a scoring profile $\prof$ and an interpretation under the form of an equivalence relation $\sim$ on the set of profiles, we can define which information should be visible in a visualization of $\prof$ under $\sim$. To check that this summarized information is appropriate, we can check that any two equivalent profiles (according to $\sim$) have the same summarized information (in which case the summary contains no more than allowed); and that any two non equivalent profiles have different visualization (in which case the summary contains no less than allowed). 
 Note that this does not guarantee absence of redundant information.
We write $O$ to refer to an ordering, $I$ to indicate an information of interval scale type, and $A$ for absolute, where no transformation of the numbers is allowed. For example, under the OM-NC interpretation, it should be possible to determine, for each voter, the ordering of the alternatives, which we write as an ordering over the scores. \commentOC{Now I don’t think this is useful. We should directly talk about the visualizations as described above.}

\section{Another possible starting point}
We call \emph{snapshot} a particular piece of information to be shown to the user \commentOC{TODO find a better name}. Let us distinguish snapshots by kind, depending on the operations permitted.
\begin{itemize}
	\item A snapshot $s$ of kind “Orders per voter”, $s \in \weakors^\allvoters$, corresponds to the usual conception of a profile: it associates each voter to a weak order on the set of alternatives. \commentOC{I switched to weak orders, to be discussed.}
	\item The kind “Intensities per voter”, $s = (s_1, s_2), s_1 \in \weakors^\allvoters, s_2 \in \weakors[\allalts × \allalts]^\allvoters$ permits, in supplement, for each voter, to compare differences of preference between two alternatives, for example, voter $i$ has a bigger difference of preference for $a$ compared to $b$ than for $c$ compared to $d$.
	\item The kind “Comparable intensities”, $s = (s_1, s_2), s_1 \in \weakors^\allvoters, s_2 \subseteq (\allvoters × \allalts × \allalts)$ permits, in supplement, to compare differences of preferences across voters, for example, voter $i$’s difference of preference for $a$ compared to $b$ is bigger than voter $j$’s difference of preference for $c$ compared to $d$.
	\item The kind “Scores per voter”, $s \in (\R^\allalts)^\allvoters$ associates each voter and alternative to an absolute score given by that voter to this alternative. It permits to compare intensities across voters, and…  (to be continued?)
	\item The kind “Enumerate orders”, $s \subseteq \weakors$, only permits to enumerate weak orders, but not to know which voter each is associated to.
	\item The kind “Majorities strengths”, $s \in \intvl{1, n}^{(\allalts × \allalts)}$, permits to associate to each pair of alternatives the number of persons who strictly prefer the first one to the second one.
\end{itemize}

\section{Properties of visu}
We consider a visualization of a profile under an interpretation as a function $V_\sim(\prof)$ that maps profiles to drawings, $V: \allprofs → D$, with $D$ the set of possible drawings (we do not describe $D$). We consider it is possible to apply a renaming to the resulting drawing and that it is an internal operation, thus, for any $V$, we consider defined, for any permutation $\sigma$ on $\allalts$, an internal operation $\sigma_D: V(\allprofs) → V(\allprofs)$, where $V(\allprofs) \subseteq D$ is the image of $V$.

When the visualization should show a profile $\prof$ under an interpretation $\sim$, the visualization should satisfy the following properties.
\begin{description}
	\item[neutrality] The visualization treats all alternatives equally: if $\prof'$ contains the same information with alternatives renamed using a permutation $\sigma$ on $\allalts$, then $V(\prof') = \sigma(V(\prof))$.
\end{description}

\section{Representative elements}
This is probably too complex wrt the added value (if any).

We define for each interpretation a set containing exactly one element per equivalence class in $\sim$. Thus some mapping, which we leave implicit, maps any two profiles $\prof, \prof'$ in the same equivalence class to the same element of the set (there is an injection from $\allprofs/\sim$ to the set). We also indicate which operations are meaningful in the given interpretation, using the following notation. $D(E)$ represents the set $E$ together with a simple discrimination operation, meaning that the elements of $E$ can be distinguished, but no other operation is allowed. $W(E)$ represents the set of weak-orders on the set $E$, and indicates that, in supplement to distinguishing the elements, the elements of $E$ can be compared pairwize to determine which one is greater. $A(\succeq)$, for some weak-order $\succeq$ over some $E$, represents $(\R^+ ∪ \{\infty\})^\succ$, with $\succ$ the strict part of $\succeq$, and allows to determine, in supplement to an ordering over $E$, how many times an element of $E$ is greater than another (smaller) element of $E$. $I(E)$ represents $\set{(\succeq, f) \suchthat \succeq \in W(E), f \in A(\succeq^*) \text{ for some } \succeq^* \in W(\succ)}$: it allows, in supplement to $W(E)$, to determine how many times a difference between a pair of elements of $E$ is greater than another difference between a pair of elements of $E$, thus, it is an interval scale.
\begin{description}
	\item[CM-FC] $I(\allalts × \allvoters)$.
	\item[CM-NC] $I(\allalts)^{D(\allvoters)}$. Example with one voter and utility function: $(a, 9), (b, 5), (c, 4)$. Then $\succ = \{(a, b), (b, c), (a, c)\}$, $\succeq^* = \{((a, c), (a, b)),\allowbreak ((a, b), (b, c)),\allowbreak ((a, c), (b, c)),\allowbreak ((a, b), (a, b)),\allowbreak ((b, c), (b, c)), ((a, c), (a, c))\}$, $A(\succeq^*) = (\R^+ ∪ \{\infty\})^{\succ^*}$, and $f = \{((a, c), (a, b), 5/4), ((a, b), (b, c), 4), ((a, c), (b, c), 5)\}$.
	\item[OM-FC] $W(\allalts × \allvoters)$.
	\item[OM-NC] $W(\allalts)^{D(\allvoters)}$, or equivalently, $W(\allalts × \allvoters)$ but restricted to the first $m$ ranks; or can be interpreted as cardinal scores (like CM-NC) but with some restrictions on the scores.
	\item[MG] $\set{Abs(\succ) \suchthat \succ \in WS(\allalts)}$
	\item[RC] …
	\item[SS]
