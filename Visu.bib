	abstract = {Regularity conditions in social welfare analysis can be seen as ways of making specific types of information "inadmissible" in welfare judgements: the evaluation is made invariant with respect to information of those types. In this sense, these conditions--often reflecting "principles" of judgement--serve also as informational constraints. In this lecture alternative approaches to social welfare evaluation are examined in this light. The analysis covers both Arrovian and Bergson--Samualsonian social welfare functions as well as principles underlying utilitarianism, Rawlsian conception of justice, notions of liberty and egality, and "historical" theories of rights and entitlements (e.g., Marx or Nozick).},

It is now appropriate to describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities. This paper proposes an organization of the information visualization literature and illustrates it with a series of examples. The result is a framework for designing new visualizations and augmenting existing designs.},
